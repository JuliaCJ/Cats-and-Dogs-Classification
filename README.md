# Cats and Dogs Image Classification

The purpose of this project is to use Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Neural Networks (NN) to classify images of cats and dogs a test accuracy above 50%. After creating and running each model, model loss and accuracy are compared on each to determine which one performed better. 

Overall, the CNN out-performed the NN in both training loss and test accuracy. The NN Model was simple, but had only a 50% accuracy on both the testing and training accuracy. The CNN model, however, had a train accuracy of 90% and a test accuracy of 85%. Although it is more complex and takes longer to run, the CNN model is overall better than the NN model.
